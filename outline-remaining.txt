		-Approximate script:
			-Traditional, synchronous lectures are very common in in-person education, and courses that recently were forced to move online have increased the presence of synchronous lectures in online education.
			- These types of lectures and courses are the most economical. Instructors need to put effort into developing lectures, but do not need to perfect them, as clarifying questions can be asked in real time, and fewer resources need to be hosted online. 
			-A study by Albert Bandura found that synchronous lectures can have increased ability to exhibit social learning , whereas asynchronous learning, be it recordings, readings, et cetera, can sometimes result in staggered social interaction, and questions needing to be remembered, saved, and trains of thought being halted. Of course, these problems can also occur in synchronous learning, if a question isn't answered, or a student needs more attention than is available during a lecture.
			-
			Overall, Synchronous lectures have some difficulties and some important considerations.
				-One issue with the typical workflow of traditional lectures is that, if a student is stuck with a concept, and unable to convince themself of the concept, they will be stuck and miss material until they are able to unstick themself. This means that they will have to pursue other learning methods for a portion of the time. This can be a significant deterrent to many choosing to use the method of synchronous lectures at all in online learning. 
				-Recording synchronous lectures is a partial solution, as it will at least prevent students from missing synchronous material after becoming stuck. It also allows lectures to be more accessible for studenst with different schedules or needs, or to prevent  students who miss a class from falling behind unnecessarily. As a result, maintaining lecture recordings is *highly* encouraged.
				-Posting instructors' notes and maintaining documents with all references from the lectures is an additional beneficial way to ensure that stuck students have help in getting unstuck.
				-Questions during synchronous lectures will typically be less applied, since students have not yet utilized the learnings, and may not have constructed their own understanding as well as if they were able to ask questions while doing some sort of reflective learning.
				-Finally, Synchronous lectures may involve some difficulty in scaling, if a class size is much larger, as the high number of questions and interuptions may disrupt the material too much. 

		-Brainstorm: What are some effective ways to make synchronous lectures in your course as scalable and effective as possible (even if you don't plan to use them)? What about in a class of 100 students?
			-Reveal: Breakout rooms (or group work) allow for synchronous lectures to involve social learning, even at a large scale. Additionally, the ability of synchronicity to allow students to see their questions answered with diagrams, demonstrations, or specific responses at the time of asking can be a great benfit.
		-Please feel free to rewatch the lecture if any concepts are unclear
