### Evaluating Projects

Projects are often a keystone of a student's experience in a course. Evaluating projects can have a large effect, not just on the student's grade but on their self-perception of their learning. 

It is highly undesirable for a student to have an inaccurate picture of how well they performed in such a large section of the course, only to be revealed at the end. 

Thus, it is critical that some of a project's evaluation should come from intermediate assignments, check ins, milestones, or otherwise. Similarly, these intermediate grades should be accompanied with adequate feedback to allow students to change course of their project if it is not up to expectations.

Applying a specific rubric can be challenging for open-ended projects. However, if possible, students can determine individual goals for projects and confirm expectations, which may be phrased as a rubric, with their instructors for the project. This allows for a more reliable and fair grading system.

Ensuring validity of grading projects can also encounter some issues. If students are presenting their work, and grades are going to be partially based off their presentation, it is difficult to decouple the presentation skills of the student, which may or may not be relevant, from the actual project learning. It is recommended to allow students a few channels to present their project, and to showcase their learning. 

If principles of fairness, reliability, and validity are followed with care, projects usually will make sense to be a large portion of the student's final grade, and students will also feel a significant sense of ownership and accomplishment for the project, likely more than assignments or examinations.
