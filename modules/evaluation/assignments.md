### Evaluating Assignments

Assignment grades can be easier than examinations, especially when assignments are provided with clear guidelines and point values specified as much as possible beforehand.

Importantly, assignments may have example solutions for similar or alternate questions, which give realistic expectations for students, in order to increase the reliability of the students' work. 

Assignments additionally should generally be graded with as much feedback and justifcation as resources allow.

In some types of courses, automatic grading of assignments is possible. This is an excellent way to be resource efficient and scalable, as well as allowing instructors full freedom to describe with great precision their expectations and grading method.

However, this does not ensure an effective grading system. Autograded assignments do add significant reliability due to lack of human variation in grading, but they are not unbiased. Instructors should make sure that the number of points being awarded for different concepts is in line with their vision for the learning goals for the class. Additionally, autograders may not be as capable of providing personal effective feedback. 

In essence, even when coming up with grading systems that may be effective and highly controlled, instructors need to put much care into the principles of validity, fairness, and reliability.
