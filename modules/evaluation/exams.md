### Evaluating Exams

Akimov et al. [(Akimov et al., 2020)](https://srhe.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2020.1730301) argue that principles of successful assessment include
* *Validity:* is an assessment testing the content that it intends to (furthermore, is this the content that was taught in the class?)?
* *Reliability:* does an assessment's score deviate highly with respect to graders, specific question choice, wording, timing, or other non-relevant factors?
* *Fairness:* does the assessment bias towards or against scores by factors not related to learning goals, such as gender, language fluency (in non-language courses), attention span, and so on?

Online courses have had notable trouble administering traditional examinations. Traditional exams, held in person, can be proctored somewhat effectively, and cheating can also be detected with statistical analysis and monitoring students, without much fear of invading students' privacy.

Online proctoring can require video footage in the student's private home, recording audio, forcing students to find space for the exam which fits certain requirements, monitoring students' internet usage and screen recording, and various other ethically dubious or inaccessible practices.

The fact that a school is not able to provide a space for an exam causes many critical issues in administering these exams.

Additionally, accommodations that many schools make for students with learning disabilities during exams, such as longer examination times, distraction-free rooms, and so on, are much more difficult in online learning.

As such, some online courses choose to forgo exams entirely, focusing evaluation into non-timed assignment, as detailed in the following lessons. This is a relatively radical but attractive option. 

In order to keep courses fair and honest, courses with this policy will often have anti-cheating measures on assignments, which can be automated, and are less invasive (as less monitoring needs to take place), or take some steps to ensure independent work while allowing collaboration (such as making assignments more open ended and individually creative).

Alternatively, Akimov et al. [(Akimov et al., 2020)](https://srhe.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2020.1730301) investigates whether oral examination is an effective tool for assessment in online courses.

Oral examination does provide a somewhat less invasive form of examination, as excessive monitoring may not be necessary, and an examination (if necessary) can be effectively closed-note or closed-book.

Challenges include individual examination requiring many more resources than automated examinations.

*Brainstorm:* How well does oral examination fare with regard to the three principles of successful assessment?

<p>
Questions can be designed with similar goals to regular exam questions, allowing oral examinations to be valid. Oral examinations with heavy time pressure (as a regular conversation might have, or an examination where instructors need to individually examine many students) can be somewhat unreliable, if students are unable to undo some of their work during the examination
