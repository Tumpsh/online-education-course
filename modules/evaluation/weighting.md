### Weighting Evaluations

A student's final grade is challenging to construct from all the individual pieces of coursework.

Assignments are often numerous and can cover the most content, but they are a snapshot of a student's learning and can have any range of influences on the grades.

Examinations offer an unadulterated look at what a student can do without any external resources, but can be inaccessible, and are generally somewhat inauthentic experiences. Isolation and time pressure of that magnitude are not always valid scenarios to weight highly in a final grade, given the subject material.

Projects are extremely difficult to design, and courses may not include them at all, but they are possible the most authentic way to engage with material, and students typically put the most effort into these types of long-form assignments that they feel significant ownership towards.

Participation is a benefit for most students, but can be difficult to measure, inaccessible, and unnecessary for some.

If principles of fairness, reliability, and validity are followed with care, projects usually will make sense to be a large portion of the student's final grade in online courses, and students will also feel a significant sense of ownership and accomplishment for the project, likely more than assignments or examinations.

Additionally, even with the most accessible participation options, circumstances for students may come up which make participation inaccessible. In some cases, it may just be inadvisable to have a participation grade at all (or make it optional).

One possible strategy is to offer multiple different weightings. Students' lives and learning varies throughout the term, and different aspects of the course simply may not have worked for them, even if through no fault of their own. Students will typically appreciate even the knowledge that there is a "safety net" and decrease anxiety.
