### Participation

Participation is a difficult part of a student's evaluation. It is inherently somewhat out of the scope of "validity" as it is not related to a learning from the course.

Additionally participation in some forms can be difficult for students, if they are less socially integrated into the course, or less experienced and cannot give advice in forums. 

Finally, it can be difficult to find a reasonable way to grade participation, as it can take many forms. 

Grading participation in a way that allows students to understand expectations, but also participate in an organic non-forced way can be difficult, but for this reason, expectations may need to be set just a bit lower than initially thought.

Additionally, it may be difficult to even calculate a participation grade if it includes student-student interactions that may be non-public. Many students, when not participating for a grade, may participate in ways that are simply not measurable.

For this reason, one must ensure that participation grades are influenced by numerous factors, and that students can choose to participate in ways that are accessible (i.e. pseudo-anonymous), and beneficial for their learning (such as peer reviews). 

If participation requires speaking aloud in class, or asking questions directly to other students, it may be ideal to simply not include participation as a part of a grade.
