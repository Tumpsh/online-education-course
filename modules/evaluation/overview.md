### Overview

Evaluation via numerical grade is common to most, but not all courses. 

Grading is generally meant as a way to judge a student's skill, understanding, or effort in a learning outcome. 

Grading is also one of the most stressful and difficult part of a student and an instructor's course experience, and stress related to grades can have negative effects on students if implemented poorly [(HÃ¶gberg et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/02680939.2019.1686540).

Grades are used as evaluations for job recruiters, for graduating from a program, and for completing courses.

As such, finding a non-biased grading system, which allows for students with different needs to be judged fairly, is critical.
