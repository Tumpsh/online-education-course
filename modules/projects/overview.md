### Projects Overview

Projects are a major part of education as a whole, as they offer possibly the closest simulation of "real world applications" of students' knowledge. Projects can aim to replicate the work environment in which one would use course learnings, or they can encourage students to creatively apply learnings in their own topic of choice. 

Projects may be even more important in online learning, where students can run on more varying schedules, and exam-based evaluation is extremely tricky.

Some courses, in fact, are based in projects entirely.

Alternatively, some recommend making all projects optional [(Spencer, 2020)](https://spencerauthor.com/pbl-distance/).



Projects can require large amounts of planning and resources to supply students with adequate guidance and feedback along the way. In this module, we will provide some guidance in designing projects so that students can learn best, without feeling lost and feeling the need to rely on external help.
