### Status Checks

What kind of interactions will take place between students and teachers, as well as between students, during a project?

Projects can occur in parallel to lectures, or independent of lecture based learning. However, this may result in unfocused project work, and confusion about the level of expectations for a projects. Ideally, project progress is discussed at a higher level (general expectations at a certain point in the course, tips, and so on).

Students can discuss projets with each other, or even help with projects (for instance, if a project is research based, or independent, a student can collaborate with another students, colllect data from other students, or get advice on resources available for project purposes).

Facilitating student interaction related to a project can increase knowledge construction well beyond the level of traditional learning [(Koh et al., 2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751610000680)

This will additionally provide instructors with a more candid and genuine picture of the students' progress.

Additionally, students can submit explicitly timed check-ins to teachers (with optionally well-defined requirements based on the structure of the project). Important is to determine how structly a student needs to adhere to a schedule. 

More freedom is an important benefit for students with different needs, and can make the course significantly more accessible, but structure can also benefit students by preventing them from falling behind in a long term project.

Generally, the more interaction, feedback, and questions between a student and instructors allowed during a project, the better. Investing resources, such as instructor hours and set up, into student projects can pay off greatly in quality of learning.
