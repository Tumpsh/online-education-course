### An activity

For both of the projects listed, what kind of category do you think it falls into, what kind of status checks should be assigned, and should any suggestions or improvements be made to make projects more accessible, productive, creative, or engaging?

Firstly, an project synthesizing an argument about French New Wave cinema. 
* Students are instructed to consider up to 10 films from a list of films and argue about the use of at least 3 techniques in this era of cinema and their purposes. 
* Students have 6 weeks to complete the project and turn in their result, which can be in any format, which should be able to be consumed within no more than ~20 minutes. 
* In class, this project overlaps with watching French cinema from the New Wave movement for about 3 weeks, and 3 of the films will be watched and directly discussed in class. Afterward, the class moves on to contemporary French cinema, while the project continues. 
* There are no intermediate milestones or check-ins, but students can always go to office hours to ask about the project.

Secondly, a mathematics project where students are expected to start, along with the course, with the basics of real analysis, and end up proving the power rule for derivation.
* The project is broken up into assignments due every other week, where students are expected to use theorems they prove and name (which may already exist under other names in the real world) and reference them in subsequent assignments.
* By the end of the project, the student will have proven some aspects concepts in analysis such as limits, and eventually will prove an important mathematical formula.
* Finally, the student will be asked (as though none of this math is known) to argue to the professor that we can know the rate of acceleration of an object's position defined by a certain polynomial, and tell the instructor what it is.

Additionally, I would love to administer a project in this course, but I will not be able to. However, I hope you consider your course development an ongoing project with an artifact which will be tremendously influential. I encourage you to seek as much feedback as possible, and work with coworkers!
