## Types of Projects

Project based learning shifts the focus of learning from teacher-directed to a student-centered experience, where students are actively constructing knowledge. The way in which a student constructs knowledge during the project experience will be greatly influenced by the structure of the project.

* Some courses can have pre-defined projects, with generally traditional assignments, but that build on previous assignments to form a larger outcome. 
	* This can be helpful when specific lessons from a course are related to specific aspects of real world applications
	* For instance, the week of a biology lecture teaching about bioinformatics may correspond to the part of their laboratory/project where they perform bioinformatic analyses on their samples from previous weeks.
	* These projects require much planning, as the assignments need to be portioned out so that the workload along the project is reasonable, and that intermediate checkpoints can be turned in or graded meaningfully
* Alternatively, a project may give students an end goal, but less concrete steps on how to achieve that goal, and checkpoints in between, but these checkpoints may less specific and more related to general project progress. 
	* This style of project can still involve multiple lessons, but may be less in order of lectures, or involve multiple lessons in certain sections.
	* In this case, the checkpoints can also be more for the students' benefit, and require more of a participation grade than a proper evaluation.
	* However, if this is chosen, more attention must be paid to student progress individually to ensure that students are at expected pace with the project
* Additionally, a project may be very open-ended, with students choosing their own end goals from a category or list. These tend to be best for courses with either very broad learning goals, or courses with fairly well defined techniques being taught
	* These will require even more time investment during the project from instructors in order to ensure that students are keeping up with expectations, but may require less strict planning in advance
	* It is also recommended that students have time to reflect on their and other students' projects in this case, so as to widen the areas of learning for the course

*Brainstorm:* What are some long term projects you have or may in the future implement in your course? Which of these categories do they fit into?
