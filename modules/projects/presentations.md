### Presentations

One of the unique aspects of project-based-learning is the construction of an artifact. Kokotsaki et al. [(Kokotsaki et al., 2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1365480216659733) argue that the presentation of this artifact can facilitate engagement and is one of the core aspects of project-based-learning.

Presenting work from a project can be a challenging and exciting aspect of a long term project. Students may feel more pride and ownership in their work if they are able to show that work to other students, the instructors, and even the real world. 

However, students may also feel less ambitious, only have simple learning goals, and project presentations may add stress to a project-based-learning experience.

*Knowledge Check:* Do some types of projects lend themselves *less* to presentations than others? Hint: think of the three categories detailed in the project selection section

Projects where students or groups essentially follow assignments along with a natural progression of learning, the first category detailed, as somewhat less interesting to present for, since students will often come up with functionally similar results. However, presenting to an instructor (periodically, or just at the end), can help instructors give more effective feedback along the way, or clear up misconceptions and better understand the students' success with the material, even in those cases.</p>

*Brainstorm:* How can online courses implement presentations? How can presentations scale in the cases of larger or massive online courses?

<p>
Peer feedback assignments, assigning groups to present to each other, asynchronous presentation (recording presentations and uploading them), assigning students to view or reflect on a certain number of asynchronous presentations, are all great ways to allow students in larger courses to interact, present their work, and interact.</p>
