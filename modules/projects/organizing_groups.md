### Organizing Groups

Many of the projects detailed can be structured as group projects. Group work can increase social interation, naturally, and can also allow students to get help and reflect on learning in a smaller setting with other students, and feel less judgement. 

Group projects also allow for more challenging and interesting projects, which allow students to flex their different skills and master various areas.

However, group projects also have additional considerations.

* How to match students so that groups are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged in their learning or final grades
	* Strategies include conducting surveys on comfort with the course material, time spent in the relevant field, and other important factors. It is generally advisable to have some more experienced group members and some less experienced.
* How to match students so they feel comfortable with their peers and are able to collaborate efficiently.
	* In courses where students have already created friends, it can be tough to decide whether to let students choose their own groups or not
	* Certain issues can be solved by conducting group peer participation evaluations, in order to ensure students are accountable. Additionally, ensuring that students in groups have similar schedules via survey beforehand, and possibly allowing students to search for groups/group members in course forums can be beneficial.
	* [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/instructionalstrategies/groupprojects/design.html) and [EdTech Magazine](https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2020/08/how-facilitate-project-based-learning-online) both detail great tips on general group project design, but also additional aspects such as explicitly laying out time for groups to assign roles and tasks, reporting those roles in the group status checks, or pre-deciding some roles so that people have to draw on each others' skills during the project.
* How to design a project that has approximately the correct workload for the alotted time and number of students, and be flexible enough for groups with less experienced students as well.
	* This is a great challenge. One possible strategy is to make a project's workload flexible, with some goals being stretch goals, extra credit, or flexible workload to begin with (where students may choose goals with an instructor).
	* Another important factor is consistent and frequent feedback and interaction with instructors. Students should not feel forced to remain stuck on parts of a project, and should not be unclear on the goals any longer than they have to be. Allowing students to have constant open lines of communication will allow groups to get past disagreements or misunderstandings more quickly, and achieve the goals of the project in approximately the expected amount of time.


*Brainstorm:* In your course, would students benefit more from more flexibility: options to choose groups, options to choose project goals, and more social interaction? Or would they benefit more from more structure, and projects where inter-group learning is more built in? How can you combine aspects of these to make sure your group project (if there is one) is successful?
