### Readings

Readings are often included in supplemental material for a course. One often sees a course calendar with readings beside lessons scheduled, whether they are required or suggested, or even additional optional material.

In different contexts, however, readings can be quite diverse in purpose
	* Reference: Readings can be important references, with a course involving much of the specific details discussed in the readings
	* Application: A reading can contextualize information in an authentic use case scenario
	* Evidence: A reading can justify course learnings that may be abstract or seem arbitrary, even if the specific reasoning behind them is not testable material
	* History: A reading can motivate knowledge taught in the course by explaining historical context and the series of historical learnings that led up to it
	* Strategy: A reading can explain a research, development, or analytical technique that will be used by the students in the course

The single biggest issue with readings is that students simply do not do them, required or not [(Center for Enhanced Teaching & Learning)](https://unbtls.ca/teachingtips/requiredreadings.html). 

This devalues the readings, and devalues the concept of requirement in the course. Clarity over what will be assessed, what will be necessary, what will give students extra credit, and what material is contained where, is critical for an accessible online course. Students have enough difficulty navigating different learning management systems without unspoken truths and confusions clogging up their course.

Readings, however, can be used as a form of information learning very effectively in some styles of courses. If readings are properly integrated with the course, they can be effective and engaging. 

If a reading is going to be absolutely necessary to understand the course, include it as a main part of information learning, not as an addendum. Write a lecture integrating and outlining the reading, or do a class discussion on the reading.

One critical challenge with readings is the difficulty for students to know which parts of a reading to focus on. 
	* As a result, do not test on reading details in a closed-book setting. Testing on reading material in an open-book setting can be effective, as it will allow students to contextualize learnings from readings.
	* Ask students to write their own questions on the reading material. This will allow you to emphasize the important parts, and allow students to engage with the reading.
	* In order to help students engage with readings,[Fiona Hunt notes that](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/course-design-ideas/getting-your-students-to-engage-with-course-readings/) breakout groups and reflection can be important to aid with more rigid and dry forms of information learning.

*Brainstorm:* What types of readings have you encountered in courses? What types of readings, described above, would you classify a novel in a high school english course? A journal article in a biology seminar? A book in a philosophy course? An original article explaining a key technique in a chemistry laboratory?

*Brainstorm:* What are some techniques to encourage information learning in each of these, and how would you evaluate this learning (if at all)?
