### Synchronous Lectures

This first lesson is going to be recorded as a video [here](TODO). Upon first watch, please do not pause the video.

<details><summary>What are some effective ways to make synchronous lectures in your course as scalable and effective as possible (even if you don't plan to use them)? How would this change if you had a class of 100 students?</summary>
<p>
Breakout rooms (or group work) allow for synchronous lectures to involve social learning, even at a large scale. Additionally, the ability of synchronicity to allow students to see their questions answered with diagrams, demonstrations, or specific responses at the time of asking can be a great benfit.
