### Seminars

Seminars are a method of information learning in which learning is primarily constructed socially, through discussion. In the methods of information learning, seminars may be the most reflective. They can also be a fantastic tool for engaging students better in an online setting, as they are the most innately participatory and social.

Seminars are most frequently used in smaller courses; however, elements of seminar style discussions can be useful in larger courses with a more diverse student populace.

Cundell et al. [(Cundel et al., 2018)](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1191493.pdf) explored student ratings of various class activities in a seminar-based teacher education course. Of the activities rated the highest, common features included use of a forum, learner-learner interaction, sharing work, and receiving feedback. 

In courses where students can share individual expertise and perspective on a topic as a form of information learning for the other students, seminars are a highly effective way to engage students.
