### Flipped Classroom

A flipped classroom is a course structure in which lectures and course material are typically ingested asynchronously, and activities traditionally considered "assignments" are done in the classroom (such as practice problems). 

This addresses some of the issues with synchronous lectures, as students who get stuck in the information learning part of the material can ask for assistance from instructors precisely when they are at their sticking points.

Significant research have put flipped classrooms side by side with traditional course structures and concluded that students frequently have improved learning outcomes [(Ishak et al., 2020)](https://www.ijopr.com/article/the-role-of-pre-class-asynchronous-online-video-lectures-in-flipped-class-instruction-identifying-6443)

Additionally, students are able to spend more time on exactly the parts of the material they need to, and conversely can even skip over parts that they feel they understand adequately. Flipped classrooms, thus, put a lot of freedom and responsibility in time management and learning pace onto the students.

Please watch this Ted Talk from one of the most significant contributors to the flipped classroom philosophy, Salman Khan, creator of KhanAcademy, and generate your own thoughts about his arguments. Feel free to speed through, pause, or skip portions you find less valuable.

There appear to be two aspects of the flipped classroom that Salman Khan advocates for. The learn-at-your-own-pace independent learning, which can be provided by KhanAcademy, and the in-person discussions, which a teacher would perform.

It is difficult to implement these types of programs for different kinds of material. Effective tools have been created for many STEM fields and language learning (such as Duolingo), but it may be challenging for instructors in arts departments, or more research intensive courses to implement this type of application. In addition, KhanAcademy has been built up over years, it requires a huge number of resources to create a program like that which will allow for mastery of material at a student's own pace. If one can provide lecture recordings, a student can rewind and watch again, but not experiment as much.

The flipped classroom may not solve the issue of students wasting time in class. If a student finishes their assignments with little trouble, or early, is there any additional benefit for them to being in person? One consideration would be to allow students who have finished to help others, but this can be excessively difficult in an online setting, and potentially not as scalable.</p>

*Brainstorm:* Have you ever taken a flipped class, or someting similar? Would you be able to make your course into a flipped experience? Would it be beneficial to make *part* of your course flipped?

Many seminar based courses are essentially flipped, with students conducting readings or research on their own, and discussing in person. Many lessons within traditional courses can involve "flipped" elements, as we will discuss in the subsequent two lessons. The ability for students to learn at their own pace and discuss sticking points and learnings in person is a part of many classes!</p>

*Activity:* Unfortunately, we cannot fully emulate a flipped classroom experience with this course, but I encourage you to discuss with fellow teachers whether they have considered using a flipped classroom course structure, and their thoughts on the subject, as a replacement for the in-person "homework". It is quite a proposition, and luckily, it does not need to be implemented radically and fully to have benefits on some courses.
