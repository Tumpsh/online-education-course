### Motivation

Have you taken an online course before?

What was the format? Was it a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC)? Was it credited? Was it formally organized at all?

Have you taken an online course you did not finish?

Have you felt difficulty in focusing during online courses?

Have you felt differing stress in online courses versus those in person?

Most importantly, did you feel that you got an equally valuable outcome from online education?

## Current Difficulties in Online Education

Students in online courses have significantly lower retention rates than in person courses [(Xu et al., 2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373711413814)

Students frequently find online courses more difficult to engage in and have more difficult times motivating themselves to complete them. Lack of face-to-face interaction, pseudoanonymity, and many other factors contribute to students' lacking presence in online courses.

Additionally, in an era of increasing online learning, students are having increasing stress and mental health issues.

Evidence shows that changes in course design for similar courses in online education can result in significantly worse learning outcomes for students [(Mehlenbacher et al., 2000)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/843644?arnumber=843644). 

## Benefits of Online Education

Part of the reason online education has persisted is due to its inherent accessibility. Students are able to participate without physical requirements such as presence in a classroom, being visible to other classmates, or sometimes even being on a strict schedule at all. Additionally, the lower amounts of maintenance in some online courses can make the cost of education more and more accessible for a wider range, especially for free or inexpensive MOOCs.

## Emphases for this Course

As a result of the benefits and detriments of online education, it becomes clear that in order to continue to develop the field of online education, we must focus on improving engagement and student interaction, while emphasizing and maintaining maximal accessibility in our courses. The fact that online education being more accessible implies it is some students' only option reminds us that we must ensure it is a product of equal quality to in-person education.

The subsequent lessons will focus on techniques and how they may or may not, depending on design choices, improve a course's student engagement, social interaction, and overall learning outcomes, while maintaining high accessibility.
