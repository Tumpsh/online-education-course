### Introduction

I have been a student for a number of years, and have used various types and degrees of online learning in a number of my courses. I have been a student in a fully online masters program, I have taken a number of Massive Open Online Courses, and have used feature such as online lecture recordings and educational technology throughout my entire college experience.

I have experienced the benefits and detriments of these online tools, and I wondered if there were any specific ways to improve online courses. 

I wondered if any techniques would work specifically well in online courses, or in online courses for a specific subject. In the end, I discovered a number of techniques that seemed to be commonly studied in online settings, and many of them within multiple disciplines. 

I believe that these techniques can be applied or extended to many techniques, and, given knowledge of current issues facing students in online education courses, it is very feasible to improve a course through these techniques.
