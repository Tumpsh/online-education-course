### Overview

This course is broken up into four modules (aside from the introduction)

1. Information Learning

One goal in this course is to emphasize the value of a technique, how and when it can be best applied. I additionally aim to utilize the principles of good online course design when implementing this course.

In some lessons, when I describe a technique, I will either utilize or simulate that technique! Hopefully this will give an idea of how a certain technique may or may not be suitable for your course's needs.
