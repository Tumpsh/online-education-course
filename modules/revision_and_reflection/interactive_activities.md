### Interactive Activities

Most instructors try to involve students in lectures and other types of learning, be it to ensure that students are paying attention or to provide incentive for students to reflect on the material.

Online courses have a very different set of tools available for interaction. An instructor cannot directly see students or judge attention level in all cases.

Implements commonly used in person include cold calls on students, clicker questions, and group activities.

Cooper et al. [(Cooper et al, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-018-0123-6) investigated these methods, all described as active learning practices, to see their effects on student anxiety and outcomes.

*Cold calls and random calls*, though they may provide the most incentive to reflect, also punishes those who need help and strictly increases anxiety among students. Calling on students have a weak relationship with the active learning that interactive activities aim for, as it does not apply to each student equally, and does not allow for more insightful reflection, instead opting for questions that can be answered quickly on the spot.

Students are only actively engaged in cold calls when the question is asked of them. Paired with the possibility of asynchronous lectures and difficulty of communicating in online learning environments, cold calls and random calls may be inaccessible an non-productive in an online learning environment.

*Clicker questions or individual knowledge checks* can also increase anxiety, if they are time sensitive. Students also have increased anxiety if correct answers are tied to points that affect grades, but have decreased anxiety if points are provided for completion.

Additionally, students noted taht active learning by clicker questions allows them to confirm what they do or do not know without forced social interaction, providing added accessibility.

Students' anxiety increases when they learn that they know less than other students, but decreases when they learn that other students struggle with the same concept. Showing graphs or histograms of answers may not be beneficial for this reason. The graphs can be helpful for instructors to know which concepts to go over, but can increase anxiety for students who get those questions wrong.

Attempts to be neutral, emphasize that wrong answers are okay, and simply explain how one might arrive at the answer, can also frame the errors more accessibly.

Some answers include telling the student when to pause the lecture when a question comes up, or using an online lecture platform such as Udacity to include quizzes without time limits.</p>

Provide sufficient time for answering, give participation points for answering rather than correct answers, possibly choose not to show the class's results, or frame the response in a way that does not judge errors.</p>

*Group work* is another method for active learning, which lends itself to longer form activities. Group activities in class can involve recently discussed material, readings, or other knowledge.

As with clicker questions, group work can increase anxiety when implemented poorly. Students may feel fear of being negatively evaluated while participating in a group activity. 

Students in the study note that group activities do, however, improve learning, especially when students are comfortable with the peers in their group.

Allowing students to choose group partners can make group work more inclusive [(Cooper et al., 2017)](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.16-01-0074)
[Previous](../revision_and_reflection.md) for students in underrepresented groups, and can decrease anxiety for *all* students. In an online course, however, this can be challenging, as students may not have time or opportunity to introduce themselves to each other, and cannot easily organize into groups.


*Brainstorm:* What are some techniques for creating group activities that allow students to feel comfortable, possibly but not necessarily involving allowing them to choose their partners?

Having pairs as groups can make finding a partner easier, as fewer connections need to be made via private message or post. Additionally, having auto-generated larger groups, but allowing students adequate time to be introduced within these groups can be beneficial. Emphasizing the need for inclusivity and involving all students can help those who may feel uncomfortable in groups with people they do not know.</p>

### Additional online interactive activities

Özgüleş et al. [(Özgüleş et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10984-020-09328-9) shows an example of an interactive learning platform being used to teach architectural history. The students are given solitary time with an e-learning platform which allowed them to learn actively on their own time.

Some students in the study stated that they strongly preferred having a human to interact with, and indicated that hte interactive activities may work best as either supplements to group activities or part of a group activity.

Chang et al. [(Chang et al., 2014)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151300287X) presents an example where independent, unstructured journaling improved foreign language students' performance in an English language course. 

*Brainstorm:* What are some different techniques for combining or synthesizing new interactive activities within your classroom?

Paired clicker questions? Lecture watching buddies? Group note-taking? Creatively utilizing the vast array of online technology available to students in online learning is a huge opportunity to create authentic reflection experiences and increase social interaction.</p>
