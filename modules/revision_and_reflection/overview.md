### Revision and Reflection Overview

In this module, we will discuss techniques that allow students to reflect on material ingested in the information learning stage, correct mistakes, and engage with material in authentic ways that can help increase understanding.

A wide variety of techniques are used in traditional classrooms to allow students to let information soak in. With our focus on engagement in online learning, this period is critical for students, and can fill in gaps from information learning as well.

Some traditional techniques have applications in online learning, and there are some techniques that do not work as well in an online setting. Importantly, we aim to optimize a student's time spent reflecting to engage the student, remain accessible, and actively learn the material.

In Huang et al., [(Huang et al., 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0735633118771085) instructors in an online math course provided four strategies for increasing self-efficacy with the course material, and compared with a course that did not implement these strategies. 

The four strategies were 
	* "Affective states" or reassuring messages to students
	* "Vicarious experience" or observing someone performing a task one wants to learn to do
	* "Mastery experience" or mental practice prior to performing a task
	* "Social persuasion" or peer feedback"

These are all techniques which were not specific to a problem set or lecture, and occurred between activities. 

The course involving these measures had significantly better outcomes in practice items, exams, and task anxiety. 

Throughout the module, think about how these techniques can be applied and added to various types of reflective activities we discuss, or even information learning activities from the previous module.
