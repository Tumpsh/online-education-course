### Take Home Assignments

Take home assignments are common to mouse courses, in person or otherwise. They are some of the most common methods for promoting reflection and revisiting knowledge learned.

However, they are also a major source of disparity between students' learning experience and can make school less accessible and cause children to fall further behind.

As far as high school, cooperation between a student, the student's family, and the instructor can be invaluable in intervening with students who fall behind in homework. 

In Clausen et al. [(Clausen et al., 2020)](https://www.learntechlib.org/primary/p/216289/), the authors note that students who fall behind in homework are frequently non-contactable, and their parents may be as well, out of school hours, and that this issue is even enhanced in remote learning scenarios.

Beyond the issue of falling behind, students overall have increased difficulty focusing in online learning scenarios, a problem which is only exacerbated when the home-school locations are not separated, and when working online.

Evaluation of homework which is intended to be completed online has major drawbacks as well. 

Online homework simply cannot be assumed to have been done without external resources. Many subjects, and especially courses which use standard textbooks or question banks, will have many answers easily discoverable online. 

Students cannot be assumed to be working solitarily, and, infact, working together *should not* be discouraged or disallowed, as online learning has significant problems in lackign social interaction. 

Cheating detectors can be used, but are easily circumvented through paraphrasing or slight re-thinking.

Consequently, many traditional homework assignments and principles may not be applicable to an online setting.

Alternative course structures, such as flipped classrooms and project-based learning courses often avoid individual, graded homework assignments. 

## Possible Strategies

Transition student work to project based activities, if possible.

Alternatively, though in a similar vein, make assignments as creative and open as possible. Allow students to choose topics for their assignments, when possible. This will cause students to engage with the material further, and avoid copying.

*Brainstorm:* How might you be able to make homework assignments build on each other, with an end goal like a longer project? How might you be able to add freedom and creativity to homework questions?


Online assignments also have the *benefit* of being able to involve a wide variety of simulations and technologies. Make homework as interactive, gamified, and user friendly as possible. Assignments using physics simulators and other implements can be highly effective in giving an authentic reflection experience to students.

Do not prohibit colaboration. If possible, provide a forum for students to collaborate. Public colaboration will help students discuss and work together wile not feeling the need or possibility to directly copy answers. Instructors can also commend and correct students when they provide incorrect suggestions. One popular example of a learning-focused forum is Piazza.

When possible, ask students to justify their work with words. This can be included in courses even that use tools as rigid as coding or mathematical proofs in their assignments. Provide some area for verbal reflection to incentivize students to explain their work. This can also be room for students to reclaim points, or avoid error-carried-forward-type point deductions. For example, ask students to justify their code design (this can help identify misunderstandings that resulted in lost points from an autograder), or describe a geometric interpretation of a mathematical proof.

Finally, Provide alternative grading schemes for students who do not need or who do poorly on homework assignments. Homework can affects students inequally, especially since adherence to ruels, working with peers, and time available may vary widely. Studnts may need to be able to show their knowledge via group activities, projects, or simply revise their knowledge for exams. Multiple, fair options for grading schemes are generally a benefit for students of varying needs.
