### Peer Reviews

Peer reviews as a form of reflection or revision are essentially similar to the strategy of social persuasion described in Huang et al.

As a method of improving self-efficacy, peer reviews can improve a student's perceived capabilities, helping them understand their own abilities and others' as well.

Liang et al. [(Liang et al., 2020)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751610000357) shows an example of students in a college biology course. Students submitted a biology report and went through three rounds of self, peer, and expert assessment. Students' self assessment scores were inaccurate to the expert scores. However, their peer assessment scores were more accurate, and improved in accuracy through rounds of peer assessment.

These students were able to learn more about what makes a good paper and how to interpret a paper, simply by critically engaging with other students' work, and seeing how other students thought of their work.

The knowledge gained from peer feedback (both receiving and providing) appears to have gone beyond the knowledge in the paper. Students are able to experience a broader array of knowledge from other students' work, and are also able to improve their own writing as a result of understanding what their audience desired.

Peer reviews are efficient for giving students example assignments, helping students internalize their own strengths and weaknesses in a non-judgmental way, and providing incentive for students to improve their work, as a peer review may feel more personal and meaningful than an instructor's score.

Some important features of peer reviews in order to remain engaging and successful include
	* *Clear guidelines on how to review.* Specify if students should leave numeric or letter grades. Provide a rubric, if so. Should a student correct details, such as grammar and formatting? Should a student break feedback up into sections?
	* *Non-judgmental nature.* Students should be anonymous to their peers, if possible. If not possible, a course must emphasize the importance of constructive criticism and non-personal or judgmental feedback.
	* *Discussion.* If possible, allow students to engage with their reviewers (though may be difficult anonymously), and respond about feedback given.

*Activity:* 
How would you assess this instructor's group activity they planned, based on the knowledge you have learned in this module? What are some positives? What are some ways it could be improved?

*Chemistry Group Project - Adopt an Element*
* Students will be broken up into groups randomly, and assigned an element from the periodic table
* Groups are expected to create a presentation arguing about why someone may want to "adopt" an element (totally subjective, argue about any positive qualities of the element)
	* Groups are specifically expected to detail the discovery of the element, the abundance, and some select chemical properties 
	* Beyond this, the group should try to find at least one article or historical experiment relating to a property of their element which they find interesting

The activity seems engaging, and a good way to get students to internalize chemical properties and interesting features of the elements. It has good potential for social interaction and engagement due to the lighthearted nature and relevance to the course material. 

However, it may be beneficial to allow students to decide their own groups, depending on other features of the course. Additionally, it would be helpful for students to define roles for students in the group, in order to ensure equal work gets done. Additionally, it may be helpful to provide specific directions or questions about the media the students choose.

Finally, it may be helpful for the students to be given more opportunity to reflect on other groups' work via peer feedback or a more inter-group activity such as pairing elements together somehow.</p>
