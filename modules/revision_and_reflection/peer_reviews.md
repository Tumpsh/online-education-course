### Peer Reviews

Peer reviews as a form of reflection or revision are essentially similar to the strategy of social persuasion described in Huang et al.

As a method of improving self-efficacy, peer reviews can improve a student's perceived capabilities, helping them understand their own abilities and others' as well.

Liang et al. [(Liang et al., 2020)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751610000357) shows an example of students in a college biology course. Students submitted a biology report and went through three rounds of self, peer, and expert assessment. Students' self assessment scores were inaccurate to the expert scores. However, their peer assessment scores were more accurate, and improved in accuracy through rounds of peer assessment.

These students were able to learn more about what makes a good paper and how to interpret a paper, simply by critically engaging with other students' work, and seeing how other students thought of their work.

The knowledge gained from peer feedback (both receiving and providing) appears to have gone beyond the knowledge in the paper. Students are able to experience a broader array of knowledge from other students' work, and are also able to improve their own writing as a result of understanding what their audience desired.

Peer reviews are efficient for giving students example assignments, helping students internalize their own strengths and weaknesses in a non-judgemental way, and providing incentive for students to improve their work, as a peer review may feel more personal and meaningful than an instructor's score.

Some important features of peer reviews in order to remain engaging and successful include
	* *Clear guidelines on how to review.* Specify if students should leave numeric or letter grades. Provide a rubric, if so. Should a student correct details, such as grammar and formatting? Should a student break feedback up into sections?
	* *Non-judgemental nature.* Students should be anonymous to their peers, if possible. If not possible, a course must emphasize the importance of constructive criticism and non-personal or judgemental feedback.
	* *Discussion.* If possible, allow students to engage with their reviewers (though may be difficult anonymously), and respond about feedback given.
