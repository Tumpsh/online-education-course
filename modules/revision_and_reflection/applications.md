### Applications

Applying knowledge from a course is a primary goal of learning. If a course can answer the "why are we learning this?" question, then it will have a much easier time enagaging students.

Applying knowledge critically to a real world scenario or a simulation can provide students a model of how course knowledge is useful, and ties with Huang et al.'s notion of "vicarious experience".

## Example: 

In Steven Strogatz's famously acclaimed Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos course and corresponding textbook, he takes a break from traditional explanation of the material to [discuss a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_YCvTabMO4&list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V&index=5) of an insect outbreak proposed in a famous paper in the field. The paper applies the first few lectures of material in a straightforward way, but to a real world example.

This is to say that this technique is not specific to courses relevant to current events. STEM courses have scientific papers being published, patents being written, and inventions created. Language courses have a plethora of pop news articles to choose from. Language arts courses can find applications of art and literature to popular politics and sentiment, or analyze a more easily digestible piece of work.

## Activity:

In an article describing a history course, Dr. Eric Martone [(Martone, 2020)](http://www.jespnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_2_June_2020/2.pdf) used news media to teach content and applied skills.

*Brainstorm:* 

How does Martone describe what he calls first-level, second-level, and third-level questions?

How does Martone argue that the increase in time allotted for standardized literacy testing increases the need for activities such as integrating news media? Which of his approaches does he seem to advocate for?

Which approach do you find the most effective?

Are these approaches applicable to your area of teaching? What kinds of media might be usable in your course? 

What are some important features or things to look for in a piece of media that might be used integrated in a course?
